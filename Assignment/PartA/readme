Purpose: Simulating a 3 lift setup with 20 floors

Files in project: lift_sim_A.c, lift_sim_A.h, circularQueue.c, circularQueue.h

Test Files: sim_input
			Also, run make with DEBUG_L=1 or DEBUG_R=1 R for request thread and L for lift threads
			This will give an output same as sim_input but with a new line at the end!
			Note: lifts export will be slightly different to the input file. Requests should be exactly same

Functionality: Program take a file (sim_input) with between 50 and 100 lines of lift requests, create 4 threads and execute them 
			   with synchronisation, expoting the details into sim_output

Additional functionality: Added debug functionality to program/makefile
